# _Loggd_

This is a web extension that skips searching steps and directly brings you to the page of a movie on one of various rating websites. We currently support Letterboxd, IMDb, TMDB, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. This program was built in collaboration with GPT 3.5, which constructed the intial backend as I (Luke McMeans) constructed the frontend.

To use the extension, select a website, enter the name of a movie, and press enter. The extension will open a new tab with the first Google search result that fits your request best. Please use proper spelling, as not doing so may result in an improper result.

**_Add to Chrome_**: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/loggd/ecbepjhmbpkgmdejfekkmpoeijkcophm

(Safari and Firefox coming soon!)

**[ ! ] NOTE:** The API and CX keys for the Google search are hidden for security reasons. If you wish to use this code, please create and input your own versions in the ```popup.js``` file accordingly. They are marked via comments.
