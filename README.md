This is a Google Chrome extension that skips searching steps and directly brings you to the page of a movie on one of various rating websites. We currently support Letterboxd, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic.

This program was built in collaboration with GPT 3.5, who constructed the backend as I (Luke McMeans) constructed the frontend.
