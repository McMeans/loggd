This is a Google Chrome extension that skips searching steps and directly brings you to the page of a movie on one of various rating websites. We currently support Letterboxd, IMDb, Rotten Tomatoes, and Metacritic. This program was built in collaboration with GPT 3.5, which constructed the backend as I (Luke McMeans) constructed the frontend.

To use the extension, select a website, enter the name of a movie, and press enter. The extension will open a new tab with the first Google search result that fits your request best.
